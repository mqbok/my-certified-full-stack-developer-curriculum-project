    <p>Dear Agent <span class='blurred'>S'more</span>,</p>
    <p>We have an emergency.</p>
    <p>The secret formula for our <span class='blurred'>Mega Marshmallow</span> has been compromised. This formula is what gives our marshmallows their unmatched fluffiness and irresistible taste.</p>
    <p>We suspect <span class='blurred'>Professor Puff</span> is behind the breach. Intel suggests he has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission: <span>infiltrate the lab and retrieve the formula</span> before it’s too late.</p>
    <p>The lab’s location is <span class='blurred'>classified</span>. Any leak could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
    <p>Good luck, Agent. The fluff depends on you.</p>
